## About
SpeedScout16 is a simple app to collect match performance data for the 2016 FIRST Robotics Competition game.  The app stores all data locally without any required network connection.  It exports each match as a csv file via email, Dropbox, or any app that can accept csv files.  For simple scouting data collection via email, see [SpeedScoutParser](https://github.com/dkt01/SpeedScoutParser).

Special thanks to Jacob Steineke of FRC team 3944 who wrote the original iOS app, and good luck to all teams competing!
